        <h1>The Key Differences of Writing in Google Docs VS HTML5</h1>
        <p> Welcome to our article. Today we will be discussing the key differences between writing in a googl doc versus writing 
            in HTML 5. Before hopping into why these channels of writing are different, lets take a look at the characteristics of
            both channels. </p>
            <h2>Writing in Google Docs</h2>
            <p>This subsection will discover what characteristics make writing in Google Docs unique</p>
                <h3>User Interface</h3>
                <P>One thing that Google does well is providing a clean and unique interface to make writing with their tools an absoulte joy. 
                    When starting your document, you are provided with many options of how to format your work whether it be a resume, 
                    resreach paper, note, etc. This helps the user format their work as they wish to create a beautiful piece of work. 
                </P>
                <h3>Personalisation</h3>
                <p>Another aspect of Google Docs that makes it much more unique is that the ability to customize your work with fonts and colours 
                    very easily. In comparision to html, Google Docs requires you to click a couple buttons to change your font or your 
                colour of your text.</p>
            <h2>Writing in HTML5</h2>

                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p>When writing in HTML5 there are a lot of set rules that make the coding in an html document very specific which 
                    could act as a barrier for some people who seem intimidated by all the words and "scaffolding" that is present.
                </p>
                <h3>End Result</h3>
                <p>A big differenciating factor that is prominent in html, is the fact that until you go through a couple of hurdles
                    your end result of your work. This may also act as another barrier from people using it as it adds extra hurdles to have 
                    your end product in hand.

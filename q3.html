        <h2>Old Fashion</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>The technology used with old fashioned word processing has to due with physical tools such as a typewriter and physical paper 
                to process any information you wish to either display or publish. What makes the old fashioned technolpogy different is that a lot of 
                these physcial tools are very specific to it's time. The argument can be made that both html and desktop publishing use some of the same technology.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The process of writing the old fashioned way was that text and characters were physically arranged on a plate (compositor) and then used to print onto paper. It was a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. </p>
        </section>
        <h2>Desktop Publishing</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>The technology used in desktop publishing often required some technology that was modernized for the time. Some of the technology used was 
                a personal computer, an external keyboard, a floppy disk, and an external mouse. Most of these technologies can be seen today and are not as 
                obsolete as we think they are.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The process of doing desktop publishing differs from that of the others as digital tools allow the user to lay out text and images on a page, offering high flexibility and precision. Elements like fonts, margins, and colors can be adjusted and previewed on-screen.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p> The technology used in html and css are mostly intangible. We need to use a laptop/PC, software such as VS Code, and servers.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p> HTML uses tags and other syntax to define the structure of pages. Text and images are laid out in a browser, with content rendered dynamically. Oftentimes 
                with regards to HTML, you must also process the actual code and debug it which is usually a feature of the software used.

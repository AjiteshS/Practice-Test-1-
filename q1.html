           The following word is an example of text that is emphasized: <em>Yellow</em>.

    <section id="2">
        <h2>...Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>This is a paragraph explaining why using the tags "strong" and "em" are a better than "i" and "b"
            Lets use some examples and test why 1 might be better than the other. I am going to use the word Hello and Yellow. 
            Written above is an example using the "em" and "strength". Here is an example using "b" and "i"   <b>Hello</b> <i>Yellow</i>. This example 
            shows that by using "strong" and "em" tags ensures that the word is stressed and important information while the generic "i" and "b"
            tags show that the form of the word is changed.
